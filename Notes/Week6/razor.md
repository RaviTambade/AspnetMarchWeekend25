# Razor views
Razor views in ASP.NET Core are powerful and designed to make building dynamic, server-rendered web UIs easier and cleaner. Here are some of the **best features** of Razor views:

---

### ✅ **1. Clean Syntax with Razor Markup**
- Razor syntax combines HTML and C# seamlessly.
- You can embed C# code directly in `.cshtml` files using `@`, which feels natural and concise.
```html
<p>Hello, @Model.Name!</p>
```

---

### ✅ **2. Strongly Typed Views**
- You can pass a model to your view and get **IntelliSense support** in the view.
```csharp
@model MyApp.Models.User
<h1>@Model.FirstName</h1>
```

---

### ✅ **3. Layouts and Partial Views**
- Promote **reusability and consistency** across pages:
  - **_Layout.cshtml** = like a master page / site template.
  - **Partial views** = reusable components (e.g., navbars, footers, cards).
```csharp
@await Html.PartialAsync("_LoginPartial")
```

---

### ✅ **4. Tag Helpers**
- Tag Helpers make Razor views look like regular HTML but allow rich server-side functionality.
- For example, the `asp-for` helper binds form fields to model properties.
```html
<input asp-for="Email" />
```

---

### ✅ **5. View Components**
- Like partial views, but with more power (support for logic and dependency injection).
- Great for things like sidebars, recent posts, or notifications.

---

### ✅ **6. IntelliSense and Compilation**
- Razor views are compiled (not interpreted), so you get **build-time error checking** and better performance.
- Full IntelliSense in Visual Studio / VS Code improves productivity.

---

### ✅ **7. Asynchronous Support**
- Razor views support asynchronous rendering using `await`, which improves scalability.
```csharp
@await Html.PartialAsync("_MyComponent")
```

---

### ✅ **8. Separation of Concerns**
- Razor views focus purely on the presentation layer.
- Logic lives in controllers or services, not in the views.

---

### ✅ **9. Cross-Platform and Open Source**
- Razor is part of ASP.NET Core, which is fully cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- You can run your Razor-based app anywhere .NET Core is supported.

---

### ✅ **10. Blazor Compatibility**
- Razor syntax is also used in **Blazor**, so if you later move to client-side WebAssembly, your Razor knowledge carries over.
