# BackgroundService

In ASP.NET Core microservices, a `BackgroundService` is a powerful abstraction used to run **long-running tasks or background processes** that are **independent of HTTP requests**.

---

### ðŸ”§ What is `BackgroundService`?

`BackgroundService` is an abstract base class provided by ASP.NET Core (in `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`) that simplifies the creation of **hosted services** running in the background.

Itâ€™s commonly used for:

* **Message queue consumers** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
* **Polling jobs**
* **Scheduled tasks**
* **Health checks**
* **Event listeners**
* **Worker-based microservices**

---

### ðŸ§  Core Concept:

When you inherit from `BackgroundService`, you implement the method:

```csharp
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
```

This method runs in the background **asynchronously** when the application starts and continues until it shuts down or the service is stopped.

### ðŸ§± How it fits in Microservice Architecture

| Role                            | Description                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Decouple Logic**              | Separates background jobs (like listening to queues) from request-response HTTP pipeline.         |
| **Infrastructure Microservice** | Great for implementing worker services that subscribe to events, e.g., from RabbitMQ.             |
| **Reliable Consumers**          | Useful for continuously running processes like reading messages from a queue and processing them. |
| **Resilience**                  | Allows graceful cancellation and error handling via the `CancellationToken`.                      |

### âœ… Example: RabbitMQ Consumer in BackgroundService

```csharp
public class OrderConsumerService : BackgroundService
{
    private readonly IModel _channel;

    public OrderConsumerService(IModel channel)
    {
        _channel = channel;
    }

    protected override Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
    {
        var consumer = new EventingBasicConsumer(_channel);
        consumer.Received += (model, ea) =>
        {
            var body = ea.Body.ToArray();
            var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(body);
            Console.WriteLine($"Received: {message}");
            // Process order...
        };

        _channel.BasicConsume(queue: "orderQueue", autoAck: true, consumer: consumer);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

Then register it in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHostedService<OrderConsumerService>();
```

### ðŸ›  Summary

| Feature                       | Purpose                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hosted Lifecycle**          | Starts with app, stops with app.                 |
| **Background Processing**     | Runs independently of HTTP pipeline.             |
| **Cancellation Support**      | Uses `CancellationToken` for graceful shutdown.  |
| **Fits Worker Microservices** | Ideal for consumers or processing microservices. |
