**"Minimal Code Strategy"**

- **Minimal code strategy** means:  
  ➔ *Write as little code as possible to get a working, clean solution.*  
  ➔ Focus on **simplicity**, **clarity**, **maintainability**, and **directness**.
  
In software, it usually involves:
- Removing unnecessary boilerplate (extra code that isn't really needed).
- Writing direct, short methods.
- Avoiding overengineering (like too many layers or patterns when not needed).
- Using frameworks/features that reduce repetitive work.

**Basic ASP.NET Core Web API?**

An **ASP.NET Core Web API** is a **backend application** that **exposes HTTP endpoints** to interact with data — like a server giving information to a mobile app, website, or another system.

A **Basic ASP.NET Core Web API** does a few simple things:
- Has endpoints like `/products`, `/users`, `/orders`.
- Handles HTTP verbs: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`.
- Accepts input (e.g., JSON), processes it, and returns output (e.g., JSON).

Minimal code strategy fits well because ASP.NET Core now supports **Minimal APIs** — super lightweight APIs without lots of ceremony.

---
**Example of a Basic Minimal ASP.NET Core Web API:**

```csharp
// Program.cs (no Controllers needed!)
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

// Example: GET /products
app.MapGet("/products", () =>
{
    var products = new[] {
        new { Id = 1, Name = "Laptop" },
        new { Id = 2, Name = "Phone" }
    };
    return products;
});

// Example: POST /products
app.MapPost("/products", (Product product) =>
{
    // Here you'd save the product to a database (this is just an example)
    return Results.Created($"/products/{product.Id}", product);
});

// Define the Product model
record Product(int Id, string Name);

app.Run();
```

✅ No controllers, no extra files — just `Program.cs`.  
✅ This is called **Minimal API** style in ASP.NET Core (introduced from .NET 6).



- **Minimal code strategy** = *keep things as simple and small as possible*.
- **Basic ASP.NET Core Web API** = *a backend app serving HTTP requests using simple endpoints*.


```csharp
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

This is called a **model** or **entity** — it defines what a "Product" looks like in your application.

---

✅ **Meaning of each part:**
- `Id` → unique identifier of the product (like 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- `Name` → the product's name (like "Laptop", "Phone")
- `Price` → how much the product costs

---

### Where to put it?
You can either:
- **Option 1 (quick)**: Write it at the bottom of your `Program.cs` (as I did for simplicity).
- **Option 2 (better organization)**: Create a new file called `Product.cs` in your project and put only the `Product` class there.

Example of a separate `Product.cs` file:

```csharp
// Product.cs
public class Product
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
```

Then in your `Program.cs`, **add**:

```csharp
using YourProjectNamespace;
```
(Replace `YourProjectNamespace` with your actual project name.)

---

**Product.cs** just holds the **Product model** — it describes what fields a product has!

## When to go for minimal asp.net core web api or Controller based asp.net core Web api


| **Minimal API (Minimal code)** | **Separate Controller and Model (Traditional Web API)** |
|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Very **fast** to write small APIs | ✅ **Better structure** for big/enterprise projects |
| ✅ Perfect for **small projects, demos, internal tools** | ✅ Good for **large projects** (with many entities like Products, Orders, Customers...) |
| ✅ Less ceremony (no Controllers, just MapGet, MapPost) | ✅ Follows **solid MVC architecture** (Model-View-Controller) |
| ✅ Better **performance** (slightly faster startup) | ✅ Easier to **maintain, extend, and test** |
| ❌ Becomes messy when project **grows bigger** | ❌ More boilerplate (extra code files and setup) |
| ❌ Harder to manage **authorization, validation, business rules** cleanly | ❌ Slower to write simple APIs |

---

### Simple way to choose:

- 🔵 **Use Minimal APIs** if:
  - Your app is small, like a simple CRUD app, or a microservice.
  - You want faster prototyping.
  - You are building **internal tools**, PoC (Proof of Concept), demo apps.

- 🟠 **Use Controllers** if:
  - You are building a **real commercial app** (e-commerce, CRM, etc.).
  - You have **complex business logic**, **many entities**, or **different API versions**.
  - You work in a **team** (others will understand traditional structure better).

---

### Quick Example:

| | Minimal API | Controller API |
|:-|:-|:-|
| File structure | Only Program.cs + Model.cs | Controllers/, Models/, maybe Services/ |
| Complexity | Very low | Medium-High |
| Scalability | Low for big apps | High for big apps |

---

### Summary:
- **Small app?** → Minimal API  
- **Big app (serious project)?** → Controller + Model (traditional Web API)

---
> **Pro tip**: Even big companies are starting to use Minimal APIs with a little structure (like small service classes), but for now, if you are learning or working professionally, **traditional Controllers** are a safer bet. ✅
