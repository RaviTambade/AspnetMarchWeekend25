### Understanding State Management in ASP.NET Core**

> *"Imagine you're building a web application like an online shopping cart. A user adds items to the cart, navigates across pages, but unless you track the user’s actions and preferences, all that information is lost. That’s where **State Management** becomes essential. Let's explore how we handle this using ASP.NET Core."*

### 🌐 **1. What is State Management?**

> “Web is stateless by nature. Every time a request is made, the server forgets who you are. So if you're shopping online and move from one page to another, the server won’t remember what was in your cart. We need to *manage state* to store temporary or persistent user data across requests.”


### 🧭 **2. Types of State Management**

#### 🧊 **Client-Side State Management**

*Stored in the user's browser.*

* **Cookies** – Small key-value data stored by the server on the client’s browser. Max size \~4KB.
* **Local Storage** – Stores key-value pairs in the browser, accessible even after restarting.
* **Session Storage** – Similar to local storage but limited to the session (deleted after tab closes).
* **Query Strings** – Pass data via URL parameters.

> *“Use client-side state when you want fast, browser-local data not meant for sensitive or secure operations.”*

#### 🧩 **Server-Side State Management**

*Stored on the server.*

* **Session Variables** – Stores user-specific data on the server using a session ID (linked with a cookie).
* **Application State** – Data shared by all users across the application (used rarely and carefully).

> *“Use server-side state when you want secure, user-specific or critical data not exposed to the browser.”*


### 🧪 **3. Hands-On: Creating a Demo ASP.NET Core MVC App**

> “Let’s build an ASP.NET Core MVC application in Visual Studio. We’ll add views and controllers, then try storing data using cookies, local storage, and session storage.”

#### 👨‍💻 Server-Side Cookie Example (C#)

```csharp
Response.Cookies.Append("username", "Ravi", new CookieOptions
{
    Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(1)
});
```

* **Read it back** using:

```csharp
var username = Request.Cookies["username"];
```

> *“Cookies are created by the server but stored in the client's browser. Useful for small, persistent data.”*


### 🖥️ **4. Using JavaScript for Local Storage**

#### Set Data:

```javascript
localStorage.setItem("mydata", "MentorAsAService");
```

#### Get Data:

```javascript
let data = localStorage.getItem("mydata");
document.getElementById("paraLocalStorage").innerHTML = data || "No data found";
```

> *“Local storage is very handy for storing user preferences, themes, or caching lightweight data between sessions.”*


### 📄 **5. Using JavaScript for Session Storage**

#### Set Data:

```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem("mySessionData", "MentorSession");
```

#### Get Data:

```javascript
let sessionData = sessionStorage.getItem("mySessionData");
document.getElementById("paraSessionStorage").innerHTML = sessionData || "No session data found";
```

> *“Session storage is tab-specific. Open the same URL in a new tab – no session data there!”*


### 🧠 **6. Key Observations from the Workshop**

* Data in **local storage** is shared across all tabs for the same domain.
* Data in **session storage** is isolated per tab.
* **Cookies** are most often used with authentication (e.g., login tokens).
* **You have no control** over client-side storage—users can clear it anytime.
* **Don’t use local/session storage for sensitive data.** They're readable by anyone with browser access.


### 🖼️ **7. Real-Life Analogy**

> *“Cookies, Local Storage, and Session Storage are like visitor passes in a building:*
>
> * Cookies are laminated passes given at the gate.
> * Local Storage is your own locker in the building.
> * Session Storage is a small desk drawer – only available while you're in the room.”\*


### 🏁 **8. Final Thoughts**

> *“Web developers must master state management to deliver a seamless user experience. Start with simple data, experiment with cookies, local/session storage, then move to complex server-side state like Session variables or distributed cache."*

### 🧰 Recommended Mini Practice

* Create an MVC app with 3 views: **Home**, **About**, **Contact**
* Implement:

  * Cookie write & read in Home
  * LocalStorage interaction in About
  * SessionStorage interaction in Contact
* Use JavaScript for client-side logic, and Razor/C# for server-side logic.

###  *“The Art of Remembering – State Management in ASP.NET Core”*

> *"Imagine you're shopping online, adding items to your cart. Suddenly, your page reloads… and everything is gone! Frustrating, right? That's where **state management** comes in — like a memory for your web application."*

 

#### 🎯 Chapter 1: **Why State Management?**

In real life, when you walk into a store and pick up a basket, it stays with you. But web applications forget everything unless you *explicitly* teach them how to remember — across page reloads, across users, and across time.

Just like a store uses a shopping cart to *track your items*, a web app needs:

* 🧠 Memory for the user (client-side)
* 🧠 Memory for the system (server-side)

 

#### 🌐 Chapter 2: **Client-Side State – Memory at the Browser**

We explored:

✅ **Cookies** – Like sticky notes given by the server to the client
✅ **Local Storage** – Like writing info into the browser's notebook
✅ **Session Storage** – Like a temporary chalkboard, erased when the tab closes
✅ **Query Strings** – Like sending information in the URL’s visible backpack

📌**Example Walkthrough**:

* Built a basic ASP.NET Core MVC app with buttons to `Set` and `Get` local storage.
* Added JavaScript to handle client-side storage using `localStorage.setItem()` and `getItem()` via the DOM API.
* Opened DevTools to inspect how local and session data persists across tabs and sessions.

> 💡 *"Local storage is like a diary the browser keeps between visits, session storage is a whiteboard it wipes when you close the tab."*

 

#### 🖥️ Chapter 3: **Server-Side State – Memory at the Application**

Once the data crosses over from browser to server (via a form, a URL, or an API call), we explored server-side memory techniques:

✅ **ViewBag / ViewData** – Short-term memory, valid only during a single controller-to-view transfer
✅ **TempData** – Like a relay baton — passed between redirects
✅ **Session** – Like a locker assigned to each user for their session

🧪**ASP.NET Core Implementation Highlights**:

* Enabled session services using:

  ```csharp
  builder.Services.AddSession();
  app.UseSession();
  ```
* Used session in controllers:

  ```csharp
  HttpContext.Session.SetString("StartTime", DateTime.Now.ToString());
  var startTime = HttpContext.Session.GetString("StartTime");
  ```

🧭 Practical Use Case:

* Created a simple **online test application** with:

  * `StartTest`, `SubmitTest`, and `TestSummary` actions
  * Tracked start and end time using sessions to calculate test duration
  * Applied session state logic in a structured MVC flow

> 🧠 *“When building multi-user systems like e-commerce or online exams, each user must feel like the app is just for them. Session is your personal butler on the server.”*
 

#### 📡 Chapter 4: **API, Query Strings & Data Flow**

* Built a basic **Web API controller** for customer data (`/api/customer`)
* Used **query strings** in MVC to filter categories like `flowers` and `fruits`
* Demonstrated data sharing between controller and view via:

  ```csharp
  public IActionResult List(string category) {
      var items = new List<string>();
      if (category == "fruits") items.AddRange(new[] { "Apple", "Banana" });
      else if (category == "flowers") items.AddRange(new[] { "Rose", "Jasmine" });
      return View(items);
  }
  ```
 

#### 🔁 Chapter 5: **Developer Tools, GitHub, and Lifelong Learning**

> ✍️ "Don't just write code, **write your memory** into GitHub."

You modeled how to:

* Track session-related notes in a `.md` file
* Push to GitHub using:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added state management examples"
  git push
  ```

Your advice?

> ✨ "Don’t capture solved examples. Capture experiences. Solutions are temporary; skills are timeless."

 

#### 🎁 Final Takeaway – *The Developer’s Smell*

You ended with a poetic reminder:

> 🪷 *"The aroma is more important than the flower. Let your coding journey carry the fragrance of understanding, not just syntax. Today it’s cookies and sessions, tomorrow it might be AI and multimodal prompts. Learn how to think, not just what to type."*
