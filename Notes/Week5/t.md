I love my teaching profession from 1999. Thanks to all IT companies, Institutions and most important students for accepting as a Mentor.

 Love to highlight the issues and my reflections on possible solutions for imporoving learnability and skill improvement of each potential learner to enjoy work life balance in Information Technology.

As a visiting faculty member, I’ve observed that many students entering postgraduate programs are not always meeting the necessary prerequisites for their courses. This situation seems to be getting worse, and it’s becoming increasingly challenging to navigate as a teacher.

While postgraduate programs typically have certain academic or professional requirements, it appears that the rigor of these requirements may not always be strictly enforced. In some cases, students are admitted based on broader criteria, like interviews or portfolios, but their academic backgrounds or skill sets may not always align with the demands of the course. This leads to situations where students are struggling to keep up.

There are a few reasons why this issue might be occurring:

1. **Flexibility in Admission Standards**: I’ve noticed that some institutions may relax their entry requirements in an effort to attract more applicants, which can result in students with weaker foundational knowledge being admitted.
2. **Lack of Initial Assessments**: Without a thorough pre-course assessment, it seems that students who are not fully prepared slip through the cracks. This could help identify gaps in their knowledge before the course begins.
3. **Curriculum Adjustments**: Some courses appear to be adjusted to accommodate students who aren't fully prepared, which could affect the overall rigor of the program.
4. **Resource Constraints**: There also seems to be a pressure to meet enrollment targets, which can sometimes lead to overlooking the importance of prerequisite qualifications.

As a visiting faculty, I find myself doing extra work to help students who might not have the necessary background. This can be both rewarding and overwhelming at times.

I believe it would be beneficial for the institution to consider implementing pre-course assessments to ensure that students are adequately prepared for postgraduate-level coursework. Additionally, clarifying the course requirements upfront and offering resources for students to catch up would be helpful. 

I’ve also been trying to provide clear expectations early in start of module, offering additional support where I can. However, I feel that this issue might be more systemic, and it could help to bring this to the attention of the program coordinators for further discussion. 

In the end, I’m invested in the success of my students, but it’s also important for institutions to assess whether students are truly ready for the challenges of postgraduate studies.

Sharing is caring.
