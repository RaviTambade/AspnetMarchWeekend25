## Mentor’s Mindful Reflection: Embracing the Teaching Journey Since 1999

I have cherished my teaching profession since 1999. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all IT companies, institutions, and most importantly, to the students who have trusted and accepted me as their mentor.

My passion lies in identifying learning challenges and reflecting on practical solutions to enhance skill development, enabling each learner to thrive while maintaining a healthy work-life balance in the dynamic world of Information Technology.

### Observations from the Field

As a visiting faculty member, I have observed a concerning trend: many students entering postgraduate programs often do not meet the essential prerequisites for their courses. Over time, this challenge seems to have intensified, making it increasingly difficult to deliver effective teaching.

Postgraduate programs typically demand a certain academic or professional foundation. However, it appears that:

* Admission criteria may be relaxed to attract more applicants.
* Students may be admitted based on interviews or portfolios, despite gaps in their academic backgrounds or skills.
* These mismatches lead to students struggling to keep pace with course demands.

### Why is This Happening?

Several factors contribute to this trend:

1. **Flexibility in Admission Standards:** To meet enrollment goals, some institutions might lower entry requirements, admitting students with weaker foundations.
2. **Lack of Pre-Course Assessments:** Without early evaluations, students with insufficient preparation can slip through unnoticed.
3. **Curriculum Adjustments:** Courses may be watered down or adjusted to accommodate less-prepared students, affecting the overall rigor.
4. **Resource and Enrollment Pressures:** Institutions often face pressures to fill seats, sometimes at the cost of maintaining prerequisite standards.

### My Role and Reflections as a Mentor

Supporting these students requires extra effort—providing remedial guidance, clarifying expectations, and offering additional resources. While this work is rewarding, it can also be overwhelming and detracts from advancing the curriculum for all.

I believe institutions would greatly benefit from:

* Implementing **pre-course assessments** to accurately gauge student readiness.
* Clearly communicating **course prerequisites** and expectations upfront.
* Offering **bridging resources or preparatory modules** for those needing to catch up.
* Engaging program coordinators in **systemic discussions** to address these challenges holistically.

Ultimately, student success is a shared responsibility. Mentors and faculty are deeply invested in their learners’ growth, but institutions must ensure that candidates are truly prepared to face the challenges of postgraduate study.

### Sharing is Caring

By openly sharing these reflections, I hope to encourage collaboration among educators, institutions, and industry partners to improve the learning ecosystem.
