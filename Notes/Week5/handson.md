### Suggested Workflow:
1. Each participant will be responsible for creating views (e.g., a product listing or a customer's profile), action methods (e.g., `CreateProduct()`, `UpdateOrder()`), and controllers (e.g., `ProductController`, `OrderController`) related to their assigned entity.
2. Participants should integrate their work with other parts of the application. For instance, the `Product` entity can be linked with the `Category` entity for filtering products.
3. Encourage collaboration between participants if necessary, as some entities may have dependencies on others (e.g., `Product` and `Category`).

These 10 entities cover a broad range of e-commerce functionalities and will allow your participants to get hands-on experience with a full-stack ASP.NET Core MVC application.
