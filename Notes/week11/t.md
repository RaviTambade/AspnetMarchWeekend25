I do understand PGDAC course is very heavy and hectic. We have been exposed to so many technologies. Sometime students just keep exploring all and get exhaused. To get a  job in software testing through CDAC placement , you need a structured preparation strategy
1.Strong foundational knowledge
2.Hands-on skills with tools used in the industry
3.Good aptitude and communication
4.Good Github Proffile built in few months and interview preparation

### 🔹 **Step 1: Strengthen Core Fundamentals**

> Goal: Understand the basics of software testing and SDLC.
* 📘 Learn SDLC & STLC (Software Development & Testing Life Cycle)
* 📘 Types of Testing:
  * Manual Testing
  * Black-box, White-box, Grey-box
  * Regression, Smoke, Sanity, UAT
* 📘 Bug Lifecycle, Test Case Design Techniques
* 🧠 Learn how to write:
  * Test scenarios
  * Test cases
  * Bug reports

> 📚 Recommended:
* ISTQB Foundation Level Syllabus
* YouTube: *Guru99*, Even our  SDM repo would be good 

### 🔹 **Step 2: Master Manual Testing **

> Goal: Get hands-on with test case writing, bug reporting.
* 📝 Practice writing test cases for real apps: calculator, login forms, e-commerce sites
* 🐞 Use **Bug Tracking Tools** like **JIRA** or **Bugzilla**
* 📁 Understand requirement traceability matrix (RTM)
* 📊 Learn basic Excel skills for test documentation

### 🔹 **Step 3: Learn Automation Testing Basics**

> Goal: Learn how to automate test cases using tools.
* 💻 **Selenium WebDriver (Java or Python or NodeJS)** – most widely used
* 🧪 Understand:

  * Locators (id, xpath, css)
  * Selenium Webdriver
  * TestNG/JUnit (for test execution)
* ⚙️ Learn **Automation Frameworks**:

  * Keyword-driven
  * Data-driven
  * Page Object Model (POM)

> 📚 Tools:

* Selenium IDE
* Eclipse or IntelliJ
* Maven or Gradle

### 🔹 **Step 4: Learn API Testing**

> Goal: Gain skills in backend testing.

* 🧪 Learn **Postman**: sending requests, validating responses
* 🔁 Understand HTTP methods, status codes
* 🧰 Learn basic scripting with Postman tests

### 🔹 **Step 5: Learn Basic SQL and Database Concepts**

> Goal: Know how to test data in back-end systems.

* 📚 Learn basic SQL queries:

  * `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`
  * `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`
* 🔎 Practice writing queries to verify test results
strong backend understanding really helps


### 🔹 **Step 6: Understand Agile & DevOps Concepts**

> Goal: Get familiar with industry practices.

* 🚦 Agile Testing, Scrum Process
* 💡 Sprint planning, daily stand-up, retrospectives
* 🔧 Basic idea of CI/CD using **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions**

### 🔹 **Step 7: Resume + Mock Interviews (Parallel with Weeks 6–10)**

> Goal: Get placement-ready.

* 📝 Prepare a strong resume:

  * Highlight CDAC projects and testing skills
* 🎯 Practice:

  * Manual & Automation Testing Interview Questions
  * HR + Aptitude rounds (common in CDAC placement)
* 🤝 Join mock interview sessions or take help from CDAC mentors
