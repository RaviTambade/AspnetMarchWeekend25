### **Session Summary: Microservices Architecture with Enterprise Services**

Today’s session focused on understanding how commerce and trade concepts translate into modern software architecture, especially in enterprise applications. You emphasized shifting the focus from pure programming to **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, helping students realize that technology serves the purpose of modeling and automating real-world business processes.

Key topics covered:

* **Historical Perspective**: Commerce has evolved over 500+ years, connecting civilizations through trade routes like the Silk Road. This perspective helped illustrate how services communicate in modern systems using **Publisher-Subscriber** and **Observer design patterns**, much like merchants and information brokers did in the past.

* **Banking Domain Use Case**: A practical domain example was used to demonstrate how microservices can encapsulate core banking functionalities like transactions, account management, and notifications.

* **Hands-On Development**:

  * Created **Inventory Service** and **CRM Service** using **ASP.NET Core Web API**.
  * Built reusable components like **class libraries** for entities (`Product`) and **repositories** for data access logic.
  * Designed a structured solution folder with separate layers for **services**, **entities**, and **repositories** following clean architecture.
  * Explained how to create and register controllers, define CRUD endpoints, and map these to business logic and data stores.

* **Enterprise Messaging**: Introduced asynchronous communication using **RabbitMQ** or **Kafka**, mirroring the concept of trade messengers who carried information reliably across distances.

* **Architecture & Deployment**:

  * Discussed breaking down an e-commerce application into modular microservices like **Inventory**, **CRM**, **Payment**, **Order**, and **Authentication**.
  * Highlighted **CI/CD pipelines**, interoperability, and deployment using containers (Docker) on platforms like AWS.

* **Reflection**:
  You shared how the session became an organically evolving, interactive learning experience. The creativity and curiosity of the students elevated the discussion, turning it into more than just a technical walkthrough — it became a live exploration of how software models real-world commerce.
