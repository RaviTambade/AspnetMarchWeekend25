## ✨ Clean Code Strategy in .NET Core

### 🛠️ Scene 1: The Day Code Fought Back

It was a peaceful Monday morning. Riya, a junior developer, sat down to fix a bug in a .NET Core application written by a dev who had long left the company.

She opened the file. Her eyes widened.

```csharp
var x = d.Get(2);
```

> “What is `x`? What is `d`? What does `2` mean?” she murmured.

She dug deeper… One method called another… and another… until she reached a 500-line function named `Process()`.

She sighed, “This isn’t code. This is a jungle.”

That’s when her mentor walked in.

### 🧙 Mentor Enters: The Clean Code Wizard

“I see you’ve met the monster,” he smiled.

> “Let me show you the ancient art of **Clean Code** — the code that speaks, the code that breathes, the code that collaborates with its reader.”

---

## 🧱 Chapter 1: **Meaningful Names** – Give Life to Code

> “If your code were a story, would the characters have names like ‘x’ and ‘temp’?”

Let’s rename for clarity:

❌ `GetData()` → ✅ `GetUserById()`
❌ `tempVar` → ✅ `userDetails`
❌ `Process()` → ✅ `ProcessOrderPayment()`

Use `PascalCase` for classes and methods, `camelCase` for variables.

```csharp
public class CustomerService
{
    public Customer GetCustomerById(int id)
    {
        // Clear and meaningful
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Chapter 2: **Small Functions/Methods** – One Hero, One Job

> “A superhero saves the day. Not the day, the cat, the universe, and the neighbor’s laundry in one go.”

❌ Don’t cram logic in one method
✅ Break down into focused steps

```csharp
public void CreateUser(string name, string email)
{
    var user = new User { Name = name, Email = email };
    SaveUserToDatabase(user);
    SendWelcomeEmail(user);
}
```

Let each method do **one thing well**.

---

## 🧩 Chapter 3: **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** – One Role Per Actor

> “Don’t make your actor sing, dance, write scripts, and serve popcorn.”

Keep classes laser-focused.

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepo;
    private readonly IEmailService _emailService;

    public void RegisterUser(User user)
    {
        _userRepo.Add(user);
        _emailService.SendWelcomeEmail(user);
    }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Chapter 4: **DRY Principle** – Don’t Repeat Yourself

> “Repeating yourself in code is like repeating jokes in a stand-up show. It kills the vibe.”

❌ Copy-pasting email logic
✅ Extract into a helper/service

```csharp
public class EmailHelper
{
    public void SendWelcomeEmail(User user) { /* logic */ }
    public void SendPasswordResetEmail(User user) { /* logic */ }
}
```

---

## 🔗 Chapter 5: **Dependency Injection (DI)** – The Glue That Doesn’t Stick

> “If your class builds everything it needs — it’s a god class. And gods are hard to test.”

Use DI to inject dependencies via constructor:

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    private readonly IUserRepository _userRepo;
    public UserService(IUserRepository userRepo)
    {
        _userRepo = userRepo;
    }
}
```

**In Startup.cs:**

```csharp
services.AddScoped<IUserRepository, UserRepository>();
```

---

## ⚠️ Chapter 6: **Graceful Exception Handling** – Handle Chaos with Dignity

> “Errors will come. Handle them like a calm detective, not a panicked intern.”

Use specific exceptions and custom ones:

```csharp
try
{
    var user = _userRepo.GetUserById(id);
}
catch (UserNotFoundException ex)
{
    throw new ApplicationException("User not found", ex);
}
```

---

## 🔢 Chapter 7: **No Magic Numbers** – Decode the Code

> “Magic belongs in fantasy novels, not in your if-statements.”

❌ `if (age > 21)`
✅ `if (age > AgeLimit)`

```csharp
private const int AgeLimit = 21;
```

Clarity makes future updates easier.

---

## ⏳ Chapter 8: **Async/Await** – Non-Blocking Is the New Cool

> “Don’t block the main road for a small delivery.”

Use async for I/O:

```csharp
public async Task<IActionResult> GetUser(int id)
{
    var user = await _userRepo.GetByIdAsync(id);
    return Ok(user);
}
```

---

## 🔄 Chapter 9: **Refactor Ruthlessly**

> “Good code isn’t written. It’s rewritten.”

Watch out for:

* Long methods
* Repetition
* Poor names
* Tight coupling

**Refactor regularly**. Add unit tests. Embrace **Test-Driven Development**.

---

## 🔐 Chapter 10: **Follow SOLID Principles** – The Five Commandments

> “When your code obeys SOLID, it becomes bulletproof in real-world chaos.”

* **S** – Single Responsibility Principle
* **O** – Open/Closed Principle
* **L** – Liskov Substitution Principle
* **I** – Interface Segregation Principle
* **D** – Dependency Inversion Principle

Each principle is a **shield** against future mess.

## 🎯 Mentor’s Mission: Write Code That Lives Long

When students code, they often ask:

> *“Will this run?”*

But I want you to ask:

> *“Will someone thank me for this code 6 months later?”*

Clean code is **not a luxury**. It’s your **professional fingerprint**.

### 🚀 Next: Hands-On Mission

Would you like me to design:

* 🧪 A clean-code-based refactoring lab?
* 🎓 A mini-project enforcing SOLID + DI?
* 🧾 A checklist poster for classroom or GitHub repo?

Say the word, and we’ll build it **the clean way**.
