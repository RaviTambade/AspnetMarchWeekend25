Long ago, in the bustling land of **WebDev Valley**, young apprentice developers often got trapped in the **Chaos of Complexity** and the **Swamp of Redundant Code**. Projects became unmaintainable beasts, bloated with unused features and repeated logic.

To bring order, three golden scrolls were passed down by ancient coding sages — each etched with a sacred principle:

### 📜 Scroll 1: **DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself**

The first scroll warned:

> "One truth, one place. Repetition is a curse that breeds bugs and confusion."

**Mentor Aarya**, a wise architect, often guided her students with this parable:

> “Imagine writing your address on every door in a building. If you ever move, you’ll have to update every door! Instead, place it once at the reception. That’s DRY — keep logic in one place so updates are easy.”

🔍 **How Aarya applied it in her web temple:**

* She noticed her disciples writing the same database logic in multiple controllers. So she taught them to **create services**:

```csharp
public class UserService
{
    public User GetUserById(int id)
    {
        // One version of the truth
    }
}
```

* Instead of validating emails again and again, she showed them **data annotations**:

```csharp
[EmailAddress(ErrorMessage = "Invalid format")]
public string Email { get; set; }
```

💡 **Lesson**: If you copy-paste code more than once, your future self will cry when something breaks in *just one place* and not others.

### 📜 Scroll 2: **KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid**

The second scroll whispered:

> “Simplicity is divine. Complexity is a trap disguised as sophistication.”

Young **Ravi**, full of enthusiasm, once created an architecture so complex it needed a 20-slide PowerPoint to explain user login. Aarya gently shook her head:

> “Ravi, if your code needs a tutorial to read, it’s not genius—it’s a burden.”

⚒️ **How Aarya guided Ravi to simplicity**:

* No custom authentication service. Use the **framework's built-in tools**.

```csharp
public IActionResult Login(string username, string password)
{
    var result = _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(username, password, false, false);
    return result.Succeeded ? RedirectToAction("Index") : View();
}
```

* No event-driven architecture for a simple contact form. Just a plain MVC controller.

🏆 **Result**: Fewer bugs, fewer meetings, faster deployments.

### 📜 Scroll 3: **YAGNI — You Aren’t Gonna Need It**

This final scroll cautioned:

> “Don’t build tomorrow’s castle when today’s hut is enough.”

**Tanya**, a curious student, started building a **Payment Gateway** even before user profiles worked. She said, “We *might* add payments in Phase 3!”

Aarya smiled and replied:

> “Tanya, that’s like stocking baby diapers before your wedding. Build only what you *need now*. Cross the bridge to Phase 3 *when you reach it*.”

🪓 **How they avoided the trap**:

* No premature fields like `User.Status` or `SubscriptionType` when there were no such features planned.
* No unused services or integration points.

```csharp
// Don’t build this yet:
public class PaymentService
{
    // Feature not yet needed. Keep it out.
}
```

🔮 **Result**: Focused development, faster delivery, cleaner codebase.

## 🛡️ When All Three Scrolls Unite

Picture this: A young dev builds a **User Registration Module** using the **three scrolls**:

* **DRY**: Validation and DB logic moved to `UserService`
* **KISS**: Controller simply delegates the job — no extra fluff
* **YAGNI**: Email confirmation will only be added **when the client asks for it**

```csharp
// Controller
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Register(User user, string password)
{
    var result = await _userService.RegisterUserAsync(user, password);
    return result.Succeeded ? RedirectToAction("Login") : View();
}
```

Their app launched in record time. Fewer bugs. Happy users. Clean code.

## 🌱 **Final Wisdom from Mentor Aarya**

> “The art of software is not in how much you build — but in how much you **don’t need to build**.”

> “A good developer writes code that works. A **great developer** writes **less** code that lasts.”

Remember, dear coder:

* **DRY** helps you stay consistent
* **KISS** helps you stay sane
* **YAGNI** helps you stay focused

Let these principles **guide your fingers** as you type and **guard your mind** when tempted to over-engineer.
